				<h2>About the Artist</h2>
				<div class="entry-content">
					<p>A little bit like Mary Poppins, if she swore, had tattoos, smoked pot and had a pet ewok.</p>
					
					<p>I love my grandbabies, furbabies, human babies, family, and husband. In various order from day to day.</p>
					
					<p>I took motivational speaking from a sith college and excelled at it. I believe I was B.D.S.M. Barbie in a former life. I enjoy karaoke with my husband. I Love, Love, Love positive energies and random acts of kindness, putting love in the universe and complementing beautiful people.</p>

				<h2>My Medium</h2>
				<div class="entry-content">
					<p>I use many different mediums, such as oils, tattoo ink, spray paint, acrylics, and water colors. Oh for the........love of run on blah, blah., I will be blunt. I'm a shiny squirrel kinda gal, all the mediums, at any point. No rhyme, No reason, just beautiful chaos!</p>

				<h2>My Inspirations</h2>
				<div class="entry-content">
					<p>Are everywhere! I can find inspiration in a dream or a T.V. show. I have always been inspired by nature and animals. Waterfalls, space, and ocean themes are very common in my work. I seem to find a lot of commonality with people in the more nightmare or dark side of my expression. Take that for what it's worth. Music is always, and will always, be the backbeat and driving force behind the finish of any inspired idea I have.</p>
